    <h1>IoT Applications made by Garima Arora</h1>

    <h2 >Activity 1</h2>
    <p>
    In the first activity, we discussed IoT applications and provided team-based responses to a few questions. 
    IoT applications use machine learning techniques to analyse vast volumes of data on the cloud. 
    Communication, sensors, human data, scalability, and decision analytics are some of the key requirements.
    We talk about certain IoT app examples , including driverless automobiles and smart parking. smart homes, smart grids, and many more
    </p>

    <h2 >Activity 2</h2>
    <p>
    Activity 2's discussion of smart buildings required us to first define the term "smart," which basically meant "intelligent networking and automation, energy consumption, and independent activities." 
    Afterwards, we addressed the critical features that were required, some of which included automation, multifunctionality, adaptability, security, and real-time Next, we talked about some of the scenarios for smart buildings. 
    It involves managing power plants, maintaining temperatures in locations with different climates and areas with high population density.
    
    </p>

    <h2 >Activity 3</h2>
    <p>
    Activity 3 focused on the control interface, where we talked about high-level features like measuring sensors, eco-efficiency, preventive maintenance, and high security. 
    Then, we concentrated on the necessary components, including the various kinds of sensors, the user interface, which encompassed the front and back ends as well as mobile applications, networking, and cloud software. 
    Furthermore, we discussed about the users, who were the employees, clients, residents, and tourists.
